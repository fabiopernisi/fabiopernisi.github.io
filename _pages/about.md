Currently navigating the "exploration" phase of my life's <a href='[https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/bocconi/sitopubblico_en/navigation+tree/home/programs/master+of+science/artificial+intelligence/artificial+intelligence_hp/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration-exploitation_dilemma)'>exploration-exploitation tradeoff</a>. I am presently attending a Master of Science in AI at Bocconi (no exams left behind!), working as a Research Engineer Intern at the BMW Group (at the Munich HQ), and as a Research Assistant at the MilaNLP Lab (mainly on LLM evaluation and safety). You might also find me running and lifting heavy metal objects at the gym. *Mens sana in corpore sano!*
