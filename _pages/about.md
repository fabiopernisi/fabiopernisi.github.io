I'm deeply fascinated by AI's potential to innovate and solve real-world problems, currently enriching my skills in machine learning and AI through a Master's at Bocconi University. With hands-on experience in NLP (mainly), deep learning, and computer vision, I love diving into complex challenges, especially in areas like healthcare, model safety and ethics. My toolkit includes Python, TensorFlow, and PyTorch, fueling my projects with practical and impactful solutions. Eager for collaborative and pioneering environments, I aim to blend cutting-edge technology with ethical considerations to create a positive impact.
