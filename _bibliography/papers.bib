  title={MoniCA: Monitoring Coverage, Attitudes and Accessibility of Italian Measures in Response to COVID-19},
  author={Attanasio G., Pernisi F., Nozza D.},
  abstract={
Modern social media have been long observed as a mirror for public discourse and opinions. Especially in the face of
exceptional events, computational language tools are valuable for understanding public sentiment and reacting quickly.
During the 2019 coronavirus pandemic, the Italian government issued a series of financial measures, each unique in
target, requirements, and benefits. However, despite the many recipients, how such measures were perceived and
whether they eventually hit their goal have yet to be understood. In this resource paper, we document the collection
and release of MoniCA, a new social media dataset for MONItoring Coverage, Attitudes, and accessibility to such measures. Data include approximately ten thousand posts discussing a variety of measures in ten months. For each post, we collected annotations for sentiment, emotion, and contextual aspects. We conducted an extensive analysis using computational models to learn these aspects from text. We release a compliant version of the dataset to foster future research on computational approaches for understanding public opinion about government measures.},
